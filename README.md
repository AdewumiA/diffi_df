# diffi

This is an unofficial python implementation of the **DIFFI (Depth-based Isolation Forest Feature Importance)** Algorithm proposed by [[1]](#ref1).
A model-based approach to assess global interpretation, in terms of feature importance, of an Isolation Forest.

This implementation assumes that the model used is an instance of [scikit-learn's Isolation Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html#sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest).
